=============
Demos and example code on how to write basic memory corruption exploits on Windows.
The two examples here are a basic stack based overflow, and a Std Exception chain exploit.

Building Examples
===================
* Download Eclipse [build environment here](http://dl.dropbox.com/u/37989868/packages/cdt.exe)
* Import projects, and build!
* Hack away!

Stack Based Overflow
